# HOW TO PLAY

[Back](../README.md)

## BASIC RULES

the aim of the game is to have the lowest total in your hand, where:

- each numbered card is worth their number
- for face cards:

  - ace = 1
  - Jack = 11
  - Queen = 12
  - Black King = 13
  - Red King = -2
  - Joker = -1

each player starts off with 4 cards all face down arranged in a 2x2 grid, there is also a draw and discard pile in the center of the game table

- the draw pile is face down, the discard pile is face up
- at the start of the game, the draw pile contains all cards left over after dealing each player 4 cards, and the discard pile is empty

before the game starts each player can look at the bottom two cards in their hand.
the game begins after each player confirms they are ready, after this point they can no longer look at their cards

to end the game, a player must call "cambio"

calling cambio takes up that player's entire turn, and therefore must be done at the start of their turn, before they draw a card. after a player calls cambio, all other players are given one more turn before the game ends. Only one player can call "Cambio" per game.

once a player calls "Cambio", their hand is final, cards in their hand cannot be flipped or swapped.

## PLAYING A TURN

a turn in cambio looks like this:

- firstly, the player can either: draws a card from the draw or discard pile, or call cambio
  - if the player calls cambio, their turn ends
  - if the player draws a card, they continue their turn as described below
- the player then decides to either discard the newly drawn card, or to discard a card from their hand and replace it with the newly drawn card (to discard a card, place it face up on top of the discard pile)

  - some of the cards have special abilities when they are drawn from specifically the draw pile, then immediately discarded:

    - 7 & 8 - allows the player to look at one of their own cards
    - 9 & 10 - allows the player to look at one card belonging to another player
    - Jack - allows the player to swap two cards without looking at them
    - Queen - allows the player to look at two cards and decide whether or not to swap them

- notes for swapping cards:

  - the selected card to swap must currently belong to any player
    - this includes the player currently swapping cards
    - i.e. a player cannot swap from the draw / discard pile
  - the player can select two cards that belong to the same player, or two different players
  - the player may choose to not swap any cards

## CARD FLIPPING

- players are also able to flip cards (their own or other people's)
- for a card flip to be correct, the flipped card needs to have the same value as the top card in the discard pile
- if the card flip is correct:
  - the flipped card is moved to the discard pile
  - if the player flips another player's card:
    - the player chooses one of their own cards to replace the flipped card with
  - only one card can be correctly flipped per turn
    - i.e. after a successful flip, no player can flip a card until a new card is discarded
- if the card flip is incorrect:
  - the player that flipped is given a new card from the draw pile
  - if the player now has more than 6 cards, they are out of the game

## AT THE END OF THE GAME

- each player's score is tallied up and a winner is decided
- if the player called cambio, they need a score exclusively lower than all other players to win
- if the player did not call cambio, they need a score equal to or lower than all other players to win
- i.e. in a game with 4 players who all ended with total 2, there would be 3 winners (every player who did not call cambio)
