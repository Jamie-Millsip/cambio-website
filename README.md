# Cambio-Website

a website for playing the card game "cambio"

hosted at https://jamie-millsip.github.io/cambio-website/

# IMPORTANT

this website tracks when a player leaves the site, this is to ensure lobbys only consist of current players, and to ensure the game is not stuck waiting for a player who has left the game to take their turn

ad-blockers prevent this tracking from reaching the backend, and therefore need to be turned off when playing the game
